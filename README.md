```
cargo run
```

controls :

| everything is controlled by scrolling !       |
| scroll = move                                 |
| ctrl+scroll = zoom                            |
| alt+scroll = transform the figure             |
| shift+scroll = change the divergance criteria |
| F10 = quit                                    |
| 0-9 and q,w,e,r = change coloring             |
